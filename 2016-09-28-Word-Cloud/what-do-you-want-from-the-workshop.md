Learn more about digital archives processes that Archives NZ has implemented;  learn about tooling; share experiences; meet other Australian archivists that are involved in digital preservation.

We are at the beginning stages of managing digital content, investigating different management systems and looking at how to make these available online.  I'm currently using ICA AtoM and I'm looking at Archivematica as a digital repository.

as i am in the preliminary reseach phase in attempting to develop a Digital Archiving Preservation Statergy for the organisation any and all information, skills, tips i can acquire will be invaluable. 

Understanding of industrial-strength repeatable processes (and why that doesn't always work)

Find out about latest, practical methods for preserving digital objects

A beginner's how-to. Where to start. How talk to resistant staff.

To learn what other organisations are doing with their digital records.. in a way I hope this will lead on from Julia Mant's comment at a post-conference workshop at Christchurch that you can't just buy digital archiving in a box, it's a set of tools and processes. At my workplace (a medical college) we are looking to manage digital assets in place on the current server directories, so I'm naturally intrigued to hear about archivists who manage streams of data that need to be identified and validated. Does it have to be this way? I mean, I thought post-custodial management was the future? (just kidding)

tools to use or apply in a small non-government organisation

To hear from others already running a digital preservation system about their experiences including positives and negatives; recommendations and warnings

tips, things to avoid, ideas of processes, procedures etc.

Understanding state-of-the-art approaches with digital objects.

To gain a better understanding of the workflows, knowledge and skills required to work with born digital archives.

Ideas for early stages of planning.

We are beginning to understand the issues of preserving born-digital records in a very diverse information environment (Higher Education sector), and are proceeding with a discovery project at the moment. But, my personal focus, is that I want to get my hands dirty and learn about the issues that other environments have faced with the avaliable technology, programme and how they responded. 

A better understanding of what to look out for when processing born-digital material.

We're in the process of identifying business and technical requirements for an institutional repository to accept deposits of, among other things, born-digital research data. I'd like to pick up some ideas about requirements we may have overlooked thus far and knowledge of some pitfalls to look out for when we come to implement the system.

To learn about the tools and solutions being used in other organisations. 

I'd like to feel more comfortable with ensuring that I'm doing everything possible to appropriate process born-digital collections.

I am interested in discovering and learning what other organisations have running as digital preservation systems, practical knowledge including current best practice and challenges of digital preservation. 

Insight into shared challenges and solutions

Tools, protocols, ideas for digital archiving

Exposure to best practice of other organisations in the field.

I'd love to find out who else is discussing Social Media archiving in Australia and learn more about how organisations are managing it.

Practical implementation options; how to be strategic with other staff and assist them (can't do it all); what has worked for other mid size institutions with a significant & increasing digital presence where archives is not core to decision making.

Identifying where to start and the simple steps to take as to how to proceed

Where and how to start.

More understanding and learning about digital preservation

Learn about digital preservation methods available outside of my organisation

Learn how to process born-digital collections from the point of acquisition (from a donor's computer/s) to files being inside a preservation system and then ready for preservation actions to occur.

Insights that will assist with development of disposal authorities 

learn what is available to be able to come back to work and make recommendations

Insights on others' experiences with born-digital collections and how to process and preserve them in the face of software and hardware changes.

I'd like to come away with some tools to continue bridging the gaps in 

DP at my organisation. We are pretty good at digitisation and managing born digital, its the stuff in between we are not so good at - the redundant tech etc. I am the lone voice in this space!"

Ideas of what other doing - future trends improvements - what shared digital preservation options may be available for smaller institutions to make digital material more publicly  accessible 

Whether my tactic, of digitising as needs emerge, is what others are doing, and finding out whether others have a strategy in place we can build on. How IT departments resist Archivists... yet they can only roll back two weeks in the case of disaster recovery. That's their 'archive'. We need to get the two departments talking and I'm hoping this will give me some tools.
