<h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
<ul>
<li title="Number of digital files in the accession/extract.">Total Files: 174</li>
<li title="The total number of archive files in the accession/extract overall. Archive files are objects that wrap together one or more files such as Zip files, GZIP files, and TAR files. Knowing an accession/extract contains these objects is important as a single archive file may contain many hundreds of other files that also need to be preserved and looked after.">Total Archive Files: 0</li>
<li title="An aggregate total number of all files inside archive files.">Total Files Inside Archive Files: 0</li>
<li title="A directory is a folder in the accession/extract delineating a file system hierarchy. Total directories is the total number of directories in the accession/extract overall.">Total Directories: 11</li>
<li title="This is used to determine the number of duplicate directory (folder) names.">Total Unique Directory Names: 11</li>
<li title="The number of files that are identified based on a file format signature. A file format signature is a string in binary (or hexadecimal (hex)) that uniquely identifies a file format. Note: A signature is a more mature form of a magic number that can be read across the file. A basic magic number is a unique section at the beginning of a file that can be seen when the file is looked at with an x-ray machine (the innards of a file is examined). This number could be in binary (that is numerical) or ASCII (readable text) form.">Total Identified Files (Based on Signature): 171</li>
<li title="This is the total number of files with uncertain file format identification. DROID will help to identify the number of potential formats.">Total Multiple Identifications (Based on Signature): 0</li>
<li title="This is the number of files identified only by the file extension alone (e.g. there are no verifiable file format signatures in the file, only the file extension is provided). This number may represent files not identified at all (i.e.. there is no identification information in the DROID database).">Total Unidentified Files: 3</li>
<li title="Files that can only be identified by their extension (e.g. ".DOC" might be a Microsoft Word file, ".MP3" might be an audio file) This is a sub-set of the "Total unidentified files".">Total Extension ID Only Count: 2</li>
<li title="This is the total number of cases where the extension used does not match with the file signature.">Total Extension Mismatches: 0</li>
<li title="The total discrete file format signature identifiers in the accession/extract are used to help identify its diversity/complexity. PUID is an acronym for PRONOM Unique Identifier. PRONOM is a web-based technical registry to support digital preservation services, developed by The National Archives of the United Kingdom.">Total Discrete File Format Signature Identifiers (PUIDs) in the Accession/Extract: 7</li>
<li title="The total number of unique file extensions identified in the accession/extract. The total unique extensions across the accession/extract are another statistic we can use to identify the diversity/complexity of the accession/extract.">Total Unique Extensions Across Accession/Extract: 9</li>
<li title="Zero byte files have no binary content. They may have been created with the intention of turning into a record, e.g. a document, but they may also be indicative of a process that has corrupted the file such as a faulty extract. Zero-byte files may have a filename and extension but will have zero size.">Total Zero-byte Files in Accession/Extract: 3</li>
<li title="Total number of files across the accession/extract that are identical byte-for-byte.">Total Files with Identical Content (Checksum Value): 3</li>
<li title="Number of filenames that contain more than one space in a row, these filenames may cause some problems with some systems and may require pre-conditioning.">Total Files with Multiple Contiguous Space Characters: 0</li>
<li title="Percentage of files with formats that are positively identified by DROID, pending other processes such as format validation, this percentage may be indicative of how much of the accession/extract will need little or no intervention to ingest cleanly.">Percentage of Accession/Extract Identified: 98.3</li>
<li title="Percentage of files with formats that were not able to be identified by DROID, which could be due to a signature not being in the PRONOM database yet, the file being corrupt, a signature and extension mismatch or another reason. This percentage is indicative of how much work will be involved in processing the accession/extract.">Percentage of Accession/Extract Unidentified: 1.7</li>
